# [**tiny-dnn**](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn) based on  [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 

**header only, deep learning framework with no dependencies other than libtorch**  

#### Enabled to build with libtorch1.6 -> libtorch1.7.1  -> libtorch1.9.0　**-> libtorch1.12.1**  
#### CUDA 11.3 is required for calculation using GPU.  

#### also needs [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

**LinkOption(libtorch1.9.0):**  
-INCLUDE:?warp_size@cuda@at@@YAHXZ  

**LinkOption(libtorch1.12.1):**  
-INCLUDE:?warp_size@cuda@at@@YAHXZ -INCLUDE:?_torch_cuda_cu_linker_symbol_op_cuda@native@at@@YA?AVTensor@2@AEBV32@@Z

 [Enabled to build with **libtorch1.5** ](./README_libtorch1.5.md)

This project aims to be a wrapper for libtorch to make [**tiny-dnn**](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn) compatible with GPU.
[**tiny-dnn**](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn) really great, but unfortunately it can not be calculated on a GPU.
At first glance, this header-only framework aims to be used as written in [**tiny-dnn**](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn).

*tiny_dnn* was good, but unfortunately development has clearly stopped. Therefore, we created cpp_torch that can be used instead.
